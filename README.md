# <Horiseon>

## Description

This project is designed to emulate a main web page for a company. To help the company comply with accessibility standards, I edited the HTML and CSS files associated with the website to help consolidate redundant CSS selectors, replace non-descript div elements with appropriate, semantic HTML elements, and added comments to provide clarification on what I changed, as well as highlight the associated HTML elements for the various CSS classes/selectors. I learned proper semantic HTML element structure, and to avoid writing multiple CSS classes if the properties within are identical. 

## Usage
